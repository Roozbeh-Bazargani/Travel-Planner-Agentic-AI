When we’re busy or in a rush, we often just want a quick, reasonable itinerary that we can later adjust to our preferences. This agentic system automates the heavy lifting: it identifies the best times to visit, suggests places aligned with your interests, and drafts a timeline-style itinerary. The user can iterate on the plan through conversation, and the system remembers user preferences across sessions. That means when you come back later, you don’t have to repeat your preferences from scratch.\n\n### Why agents? -- Why are agents the right solution to this problem\n\nTrip planning spans multiple subtasks: searching for suitable attractions, checking opening hours, locating them on a map, grouping nearby locations, and avoiding unnecessary backtracking. Doing all of this manually is slow and error-prone.\n\nAgent-based design lets each subtask be handled by a specialized agent. Individually, these agents handle their domain efficiently; together, they coordinate to produce a consistent, optimized travel plan. This modular structure mirrors how a human travel planner thinks, but faster.\n\n### What you created -- What's the overall architecture? \nThe system consists of four LLM-powered agents and three tools: Google Search, save_memory, and retrieve_memory. The memory tools allow persistent user-specific information to be stored in a JSON file. The system also uses session and state management.\n\nThe agents are:\n- Place Search Agent: Suggests places to visit in a given city.\n- Route Planner Agent: Proposes a plan to minimize backtracking while checking opening hours.\n- Evaluator Agent: Reviews and critiques the travel plan to ensure quality.\n- Orchestrator Agent: Receives the user request and coordinates all other agents. Its workflow for general trip planning:\n1. Requests candidate locations from the Place Search Agent.\n2. Generates a route using the Route Planner Agent.\n3. Sends the plan to the Evaluator for review:\n- If approved, returns the plan to the user.\n- If not approved, incorporates feedback, updates the place list, and reruns planning.\n- After 3 unsuccessful evaluation cycles, it returns the best available plan.\n\n### The Build -- How you created it, what tools or technologies you used.\n1. Implemented four LLM-based agents, including an orchestrator with long-term memory.\n2. Used built-in Google Search as a tool for retrieving real-time information.\n3. Added session and state management through InMemorySessionService.\n4. Built a custom long-term memory tool using JSON files keyed by user ID. The orchestrator selectively stores only meaningful, future-useful information to keep memory lean and relevant.\n\n### If I had more time, this is what I'd do\n1. Replace the custom memory solution with Vertex AI Memory for scalability and reliability.\n2. Make the memory globally accessible to all agents instead of routing everything through the orchestrator. For example, letting the Evaluator directly read user preferences.\n3. Integrate APIs from booking platforms so the Route Planner can check live ticket availability instead of relying on a search through Google.\n4. Allow the orchestrator to handle ticket booking after user approval.\n5. More evaluation, and if needed, use sequential agents instead of giving the full execution control to the orchestrator.\n\n## 1.
